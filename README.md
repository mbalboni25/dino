#how to play  
1. select skin
2. Go back to home screen and select "play"
3. Use the space bar to jump over the obstacles and use the down arrow to duck to avoid higher obstacles
4. As you progress through the game, the speed will increase therefore making Dino Dash harder



#Troubleshooting 
If the dino does not stop while touching a obstacle, close the application and reopen
