## About The Project

we created a clone of the Dino game otherwise known as the "no Internet game". the orignal gamecan be accessed by inputting chrome://dino or chrome://network-error/-106 into the Omnibox.

what did we add:
* new Updated grapics 
* you can now change your character 
* and a new main menu :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!
